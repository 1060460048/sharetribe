== Kassi

Kassi is a community resource exchange service built with Ruby on Rails. 
It relies on Aalto Social Interface (http://github.com/sizzlelab/asi) on its 
user management and few other things, so it can't be run alone.

For serious use you need to install your own ASI or get access to an existing one, 
but for testing you can use the default test account on OtaSizzle's test server.

== Mit License

Kassi is open source under MIT license. See LICENSE file for details.
