<h1>About Kassi</h1>
<br><br>
<h2>What is Kassi?</h2>
<p>Kassi is a service that enables borrowing, buying, selling and giving away items and the exchange of various favors. 
Users of Kassi can list in their profiles the items they could lend and their expertise and other things they could do. 
These are then shown in lists that can be browsed or searched. If something is not already to be found in Kassi you can 
post a listing to ask for it. There are eigth categories of listings: Marketplace, Items to borrow, Lost property, Car pools, 
Group search, Favors, Housing and Others. You can browse the listings, favors and items to borrow without registering to the service, 
but if you want to answer to a listing or see the user profiles you have to create an user account.</p>

<p>If you have created an user account in sizl.org or in any other Otasizzle service, those credentials will be valid also for Kassi, 
because Kassi is one of the OtaSizzle services. However, every Kassi user has a personal Kassi profile that has some extra information 
(like lendable items) that is not shown elsewhere. </p>


<h2>What is the purpose of Kassi?</h2>
<p>The aim of Kassi is to make the exchange of daily favors easier in the metropolitan area. Kassi is part of 
<a href='http://sizl.org'>OtaSizzle-project</a>, a project of HUT and HIIT. It is funded by TKK’s ’Technology for Life’ campaign 
	donations from private companies and communities. The purpose of the project is to study the development and use of social web services.</p>

<h2>Who is a potential user of Kassi?</h2>
<p>Because Kassi takes advantage of its users being located on the same area, it is at the moment mainly designed 
for the Aalto University community. However, anyone can register as a user of Kassi in spite of where they live or work.</p>

<h2>Where can I ask more about Kassi?</h2>
<p>Questions conserning Kassi or another OtaSizzle service Ossi can be sent to: otasizzle-helpdesk@hiit.fi or directly to Emmi Suhonen 
(firstname.surname@tkk.fi). You can also come to ask questions face-to-face from Emmi in Aalto University School of Science and Technology's 
T-house in the room A218. Every Kassi page has also feedback form near the footer where you can send feedback or ideas to Kassi developers. </p>
